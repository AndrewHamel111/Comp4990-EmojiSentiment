Obama is charming and he makes a lot of sense. It's creepy, he must be the fucking anti-Christ or something.
I ask myself, does Obama want to decrease the role of government in my life, or increase it? As a libertarian, should I support or oppose Obama? More generally speaking, as a libertarian, should I abandon the Republican party which has done so little that is defensible from a libertarian standpoint and so much that is indefensible? Let us look.

>The junior Senator from Illinois observed that in 2006 many of America's people "have had their faith shaken." "The world has changed but things in Washington have not changed" and this has led to an assault on the American dream. Politicians in Washington are constrained by "smallness." "The timidity of our politics is holding us back."

Smallness? What smallness? Republicans today are big government Republicans, but Obama seems to think they are small-government Republicans. That's a point against Obaama.

>Barack Obama said that the solution to this problem lies in the American people. It's time for the electorate to reassert their will, to say they've "had enough." "Enough of broken promises and failed leadership. Enough of can't do and won't try." He argued that we all should have had enough of an Administration that can't make our ports safe but will spend billions on crony contracts. That claims to be serious about defending the homeland, but could not respond effectively to Hurricane Katrina. That can't come up with plan for Iraq or to ensure our national competitiveness.

This doesn't say much, it's negative about Republicans but does not give us Obama's vision, so on to the next paragraph.

>Obama remarked that the roots of this problem are clear. They lie "in the philosophy of this administration, in their believe that government is the problem." He said that taken to the extreme this ideology is "social Darwinism. The belief that we are all on our own. That each of us is responsible for our own education, healthcare, and levees."

Whoa, big problem there. Obama is attacking the belief that government is the problem. That sure is not any sort of libertarian statement. It's directly against libertarian, it's 180 degrees against libertarian. Republicans have not by any stretch of the imagination been governing to impress the more libertarian component of their constituencies. The big Republican misdeeds from a libertarian standpoint have been massive increases in government activity, starting with the war in Iraq. Government wiretapping is another concern. Airport nonsecurity, massive increases in welfare spending, proposed anti-homosexual legislation - all of these are uses or attempted uses by the Republicans of government power, and rther than attack this massive use of government power by Republicans, Obama chooses to attack Republicans for paying lip service to the idea that government is the problem!

Well, government is the problem. And that sentiment pretty much defines the libertarian point of view, so Obama is setting himself up as farther away from the libertarians than President Bush. Which is quite an accomplishment.

>The junior Senator from Illinois noted that the GOP approach does not work in a democracy. He argued that the American way of life has two components: "individual initiative and mutual regard, the belief that I am my brother's keeper and my sister's keeper." Democrats must reassert that mutual regard is a vital component of government.

That's vague rhetoric, but the notion of "brother's keeper", especially in the light of the previous assertions by Obama, suggest that Obama is making the case for a massive increase in government's role in our lives. Americans can of course be their brother's keeper by means of private charity, but Obama isn't campaigning to become president of a private charity, he's a politician, his solutions are government solutions, so he evidently wants government to do what private charities do. And that is not libertarian.

>Obama concluded that it is time for Americans to have a debate about where we are going and what we are about. Republicans have a timid vision, the downsizing of democracy. He called upon Democrats to proclaim, "that every American family deserves the right to the American dream." He argued that all Americans deserve to "dream without limits and achieve without constraints."

Republicans have a timid vision? Of what, of the government's role in society? Presumably. Well, if Obama thinks the Republicans have a timid vision of the government's role then that's another strike against Obama (and against the Democratic party, in which Obama is a, maybe the, rising star).

>On Thursday, Barack Obama shared his vision of nation building. His image of an America restored because its citizens have regained the ability to dream and to live in community. He remembered the words of Martin Luther King, Jr., "The arc of the moral universe is long but it bends toward justice." Noting that we all need to work together to bend the arc, he implored his rapt audience to join in the struggle for an America with liberty and justice for all. Obama concluded, "If [after 105 years] Marguerite Lewis isn't tired, then I'm not tired."

More vague rhetoric. In conclusion, Obama sets himself up as being on the opposite side of Republicans from libertarians. Obama is for an expansive view of government.


The Democrats seem even further away from the libertarian position than the Republicans, who are very far away. For example, Obama is a rising star among the Democrats, and does he take the Republicans to task for massively increasing the role of government in our lives? Not according to the following article, which has Obama attacking Republicans for being too anti-government (which is like attacking Jessica Simpson for being too masculine).

The article:

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/bob-burnett/nation-building-obama-st_b_20923.html

A quote from the article:

> Obama remarked that the roots of this problem are clear. They lie "in the philosophy of this administration, in their believe that government is the problem." He said that taken to the extreme this ideology is "social Darwinism. The belief that we are all on our own. That each of us is responsible for our own education, healthcare, and levees."

Obama is (if one can believe it) criticizing the Republicans for been too libertarian (which they're not) using a common slur against radical libertarians (that they are "social darwinists") against Republicans. Hearing stuff like that, much as I oppose essentially everything the Bush administration has done, I can hardly support Obama who considers Bush to be some kind of radical libertarian.
I would be intrigued if Obama played up the civil liberties side, but he doesn't in this speech, and Democrats have generally been disappointing. Basically I've written off both parties for the forseeable future. In the last election I voted libertarian, which is essentially an abstention.
"Whatever we once were, we are no longer just a Christian nation; we are also a Jewish nation, a Muslim nation, a Buddhist nation, a Hindu nation, and a nation of nonbelievers." "So before we get carried away, let's read our bibles. Folks haven't been reading their bibles." " I may be opposed to abortion for religious reasons, but if I seek to pass a law banning the practice, I cannot simply point to the teachings of my church or evoke God's will. I have to explain why abortion violates some principle that is accessible to people of all faiths, including those with no faith at all."

This is the great Democratic hope?  A man who claims we're a Muslim nation and Hindu nation?  A man who sees no rational reasons to oppose abortion?  A man who pretends to be one of the folks by exclaiming, "Folks haven't been reading their bibles."?  Please, this is sad and somewhat racist.  It reminds me of people who praise Colin Powell or Condoleeza Rice by commenting on how articulate they are.  How patronizing and condescending.  There are black intellectuals to be sure, but Thomas Sowell doesn't reach the fashionable conclusions.  Barack Obama is a polished political phony and better than most Democratic Senators at putting mainstream America at ease, nothing more or less.  Any person who in one part of their speech acknowledges the importance of the Judeo-Christian tradition in shaping our laws but then claims we're a Muslim nation, a Hindu nation and implies that opponents of abortion aren't rational and have no arguments other than divine revelation should be criticized for egregious doublespeak.  Obama wants to have his cake and eat it too.  Religious folk I'm one of you.  Rational people I'm with you and won't let the bible thumpers stop you from doing as you see fit.  People who oppose abortion, I appreciate that impulse.  People who think it's a sacrosanct constitutional right at all times for all reasons, I'm actually with you, but let's pretend that maybe a fetus is human life and not brag about partial birth abortions.



>A man who sees no rational reasons to oppose abortion?

I see no rational reasons to oppose abortion.  And this comment makes me quite a bit more comfortable with Obama as a Senator and a potential presidential candidate in 2008 or 2012.  I view the current situation wherein Roe v. Wade may be overturned as the single most dangerous issue in American politics right now, as both an indicator that the least educated people in American are now calling the shots and as an egregious violation of every human's right to control their own body.

>A man who pretends to be one of the folks by exclaiming, "Folks haven't been reading their bibles."? Please, this is sad and somewhat racist. It reminds me of people who praise Colin Powell or Condoleeza Rice by commenting on how articulate they are. How patronizing and condescending.

I don't see how the former brings the latter to mind.  The two don't seem at all corollary.  Are you, perhaps, saying that Obama is (and knows he is) in some way superior to "folks" and that by grouping himself with folks he is being condescending?  I don't think that really connects, despite your assumption that "folks" means "religious folks, I'm one of you"...that's simply not what your quote says.  I agree that a white person saying how articulate Rice or Powell are is embarassing for all white people everywhere...but I just don't see how there is any connection.

>Any person who in one part of their speech acknowledges the importance of the Judeo-Christian tradition in shaping our laws but then claims we're a Muslim nation, a Hindu nation and implies that opponents of abortion aren't rational and have no arguments other than divine revelation should be criticized for egregious doublespeak.

"Divine revelation", huh?  You got a divine revelator in your basement?  I'd like to ask it a few questions, starting with, "why did you divinely revelate yourself to a jackass who thinks he has the right to revelate on everyone's behalf?"  You, degustibus, don't speak for God, Allah, or Xenu.  You speak for you.  What you feel about abortion is your opinion...you have no right to speak for anyone elses deity or any other human being.  Get over it.  You aint got no monopoly on the truth, brother.
I don't know, he's had 128 bills and amendments.  http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/?&Db=d109&querybd=@FIELD(FLD003+@4((@1(Sen+Obama++Barack))+01763))
That's far better than most senators.  

He had far more impact at the DNC convention of 2004 than Hillary Clinton http://www.google.com/trends?q=hillary+clinton%2C+barack+obama+++&ctab=0&geo=all&date=2004


I'm not sure "better" entered into it.  nickb said he hadn't done anything, I wanted to point out that good or bad he's been busy.  McCain has about the same number of bills/admendments, true it's not a great indicator of how much they are doing but Obama is at least active in the process.
That would be fascinating! It’d be like the extremists versus the moderates.   It’d be McCain/Obama in the middle with Jerry Farwell/Pat Roberson on the right and Ted Kennedy/John Kerry on the left.  It would be crazy to watch the debates!  

I'd be the first to give them money to run if they would.  It'd make for an interesting presidency.
No it shows the same idiocy, nothing has changed really yet Obama and other of his ilk are itching for another illegal war of aggression with an soverign state.
Man, I can't believe I voted this down without reading the first time I ran across it..

The last section resonated with Barack Obama's recent [speech](http://reddit.com/info/9bfe/comments)
>Blacks leaders in this country must start to step up. 

I think more to the point the black community needs to look to real leaders such as Barak Obama, Colin Powell, and Condoleezza Rice.  McKinney, Jackson, Sharpton and the ilk have proven themselves inept.

As I said, this is an attempt at being outraged that falls flat out of the box.

"If you believe otherwise, it's instructive, for your purposes, to look at the President and Vice President's views on executive power and how those views have been made quite, quite real."

Well, it would be pretty instructive for you to look at Presidential history in general before declaring that there is something unprecedented in their philosophy.

"Rather, and for the last time, what's being said is that such talk is dangerous and should be both noted and watched. The Klan, likewise, has the right to say whatever they like in a public forum, but only a fool would toss their speech off as readily as you would in Harris's case."

Who pays attention to the Klan? What a stupid comparison.  Seriously, if this is something that is so outrageous wouldn't be to your benefit that she say it more?  I have to get back to the whole Klan bit because David Duke has to travel to Syria to find a welcome TV audience while the Klan draws more protesters than supporters when they have any rally here in the US.  You are retarded.
http://www.memritv.org/search.asp?ACT=S9&P1=941

Secondly, you would not say the same thing if it were a Muslim or a Baptist because such things have been said by Democrats concerning the President and Iraq.  In fact, Ray Nagin said that in a speech that God was angry with the US for racism and the Iraq war.  He said this at a campaign rally, so this idea that what she said crossed the line is totally ridiculous and if she didn't have an (R) in front of her name it would go unnoticed.  Most notably by you.  

Fallacy?  I don't understand what that statement is supposed to mean to you?  Is she going to institute a theocracy all by herself - as a congressman?  You don't want to hear that and thats fine, don't listen.  Its about as dangerous a statement as some Brigham Young professor claiming that the WTC collapse was a controlled demolition.  Leave that stupid crap to the moonbats that want to believe it because no one that matters takes them seriously anyway.

I don't know where the strawman lives but I have a pretty good hunch that he has a PO Box addressed in your head.  I point out that what she said isn't unusual for either party - yet you hold that because she stated a BELIEF that this is dangerous?  Also, you want to take it out of the context that she is pandering to a religious audience - this is what people do to get people to vote for them.  Clinton, Gore, Sharpton, Jackson, Obama, and every other Democrat that wants to get African American support has done the same thing.  I honestly don't know what the "merits" of your argument are - you are stating a belief yourself.  Your argument is that your belief system requires that any comment spoken to a religious audience must not suggest that the speaker feels a higher power plays a part in who gets into public office.
It's to remind you to vote Republican in November, duh!  ;)

Seriously, as bad as this administration is (and even American Conservative magazine wrote that W is incompetant and should have never been president), the Dems don't offer great choices, either.

You've got this [pandering jackass](http://wonkette.com/politics/delaware/south-of-the-border-down-delaware-way--197062.php), this [raving lunatic](http://lashawnbarber.com/archives/2005/06/08/embarrassed/), and this [gossipy, bubble head](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/12612211/) in their leadership.

C'mon, you can't find more people like Obama and Rahm Emanuel?
Frankly, because Bill is easily the most likable of all Democrats. Sure, there's Barack Obama, but he just doesn't have the same pull a former, well liked and respected president has.
He *could* run as Vice President, though.  Brings to mind possible tickets, such as Gore/Clinton, Clinton/Clinton (Hill/Bill) or Obama/Clinton.

I don't see anything about this in the robots.txt standard, so I am not so sure it *isn't* some special deal.

Well, that's just not the case, obviously. Google has no right to create a cache of the publisher's data without their explicit authorization (according to Belgian law as I, *and the judge in the case*, understand it). This is the same privacy law, by the way, that protects us from opt-out spam. I am 100% sure they understand very well how to use robots.txt, but opting out completely is not what they want.

This would never have gotten this far if Google had sent their lawyer to the court. I find it quite disrespectful of them really, I would love to know what went wrong there.

>All of us - Democrats and Republicans - want to do whatever it takes to track down terrorists and bring them to justice as swiftly as possible. **All of us want to give our President every tool necessary to do this.** And all of us were willing to do that in this bill. Anyone who says otherwise is lying to the American people.

...

> When we're sloppy and cut corners, we are undermining those very virtues of America that will lead us to success in **winning this war.**


Yeah, you're not going to win anything if you are playing their game, the bogus "war on terror."  Once you start playing your opponent's game of "fight the invisible enemy", it's a race to the bottom.  Congrats Obama, you're now racing the Republicans to see which party can be the most authoritarian.

Heads up: You're already losing that race.
Heh heh heh - "Barack Obama" - heh heh heh - he got a funny name!

I'm sendin' this terrst to Gitmo.
If all these democrats who voted against the bill really think this issue is more important than reelection, then I have one question: Why didn't anybody fillibuster this bill in the Senate? I may be missing something here but it seems like that is all Mr. Obama would have had to have done to make his point.
Obama, as junior Senator from Illinois, has "POP" popularity, but no political clout.  He will ride on Dick Durbin's coattails in Washington as junior yes man until he learns the ropes... hopefully. All the while spouting whatever nonsense his publicists - oops - political advisors hand to him.  He is a "Poster Boy", and paper thin at that.
The shrill "I hope Dems run Hillary for Prez" we often hear from the right has convinced me that they are frightened to the core of her, and she could win, but I've thought all along that Obama might be a better choice, if not in '08 then maybe the next time.
I am terrified because, after reading that the army can't sustain an occupation in a country of 26,074,906 (and falling), they are TOTALLY READY to subdue their homeland of 300,000,000. Psh, civil war. (I'll admit that number 300,000,000 might not put up a good fight). Thank god "Russian Intelligence" is all looking out for me! Whew! Gonna send those guys a sweet Christmas gift basket. A nice one, wine and chocolate. Not one of those weird ones with Austrian anchovy butter or whatever. 

Man I better vote democrat, right? If any of this shit is true in the context presented, my only hope is Hillary and Obama will stare it down with monster For-the-People wonderpowers. 

But you know, police states are fine if you're the police. Maybe I should get used to the idea of wearing brown shirts and marching? It's the beginning of a great adventure!
all that aside, bush was already under the influence of Washington mentality, when if we have someone like Obama, who is new to DC, we won't have a pesimistic and fogged up mind in the white house.  just my 2 cents...
Obama is a Senator.
Don't be so defensive. My point is that Obama's qualifications shouldn't be in question, since he is easily as qualified as our current president.
Clinton and Obama would actually be a pretty impressive ticket.
OSama Obama, same shit
I'd hate to break the bad news, but I don't think it'll happen any time soon.  The name alone will kill his chances, since many Americans will confuse Obama with Osama.
I wasn't being defensive- Bush is indefensible (is that a word?). I am just sick of hearing about it in every single story/comment section. It seems like everyone just uses that trick to get upvotes. Plus, despite what your point was, what you said was just ignorant. Bush was Gov. of Texas for 8 years. So he did have experience. Unfortunately, he turned out to be a rotten apple.

Personally, I'm excited to see what happens with Obama- he's full of great ideas, IMO.

I'm trying to make myself clear. The cut-and-paste in my post said, "his lack of experience" (referring to Obama). I went on to compare to Bush's experience -- I don't see much difference I rank senator higher than governor, but bush has more time.

The fact that you are "sick of hearing about it" could be a sign that a lot of people believe he is an inept president.

You go on to accuse me of fishing for upvotes THEN you said my post was "ignorant." I was trying to avoid falling into the name-calling trap. I doubt anyone posting here can qualify as "ignorant," but you threw that out there just because you are "sick of hearing about it." I personally, am sick of people who cannot discuss an issue without bringing it down to name calling.
Wow, America is truly fucked. And not because Obama could win the next election.
Obama's so smug for a man who hasn't even served one term in the Senate.  This hype is a sad commentary on race and politics.  Raised by his white mother he has become a black superstar because he's so articulate.  It's very condescending and patronizing to gush over a "black" man who speaks intelligibly, it's not that rare.
Obama's meteoric rise has nothing to do with his race but lots to do with his charismatic style. The guy is not only articulate (so was John Kerry) but he's also very charismatic. Just like Bush he sounds like he speaks "from the gut" but not in a crass redneck sort of way.
I guess you're naive if you find his recent conversion to Christianity credible.  I'll grant that he's a decent pol, no more or less.  He was a Democrat running against Alan Keyes in Illinois, doesn't take much to win.  Obviously to get to the point of being the party's pick they saw his talent. Obama is all spin.
The only reason Obama even got into the Senate is they caught his first opponent (not Keyes) trying to force his wife to have sex with strange men at a swinger's club. Oh yeah and his wife was an actress on Star Trek.

Like they say, you can't make this stuff up.
Red state and blue state was the color choice of the broadcasters.  In previous elections the colors were reversed.  Some suspect the Democrats hated being associated with red (think commie).  At any rate, I don't think you can give Obama credit for it, but it shows how effective the p.r. has been for this guy.  Next we'll hear how he ghostwrites for Colbert.

[red blue divide article at wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_state_vs._blue_state_divide)
I would vote for Obama in a heartbeat.
Desustibus, you're not allowed to say such things on Reddit or hold such opinions around here. Everyone knows that in modern progressive America issues like race, sexuality and religion don't matter and therefore should never be part of the public discourse. Especially on Reddit. We prefer to keep them in our head and not speak of them. And when you do speak up in the future try to make it conform more with the unwritten code of conduct on Reddit.com.

Sarcasm aside, I disagree with you about Obama somewhat. I like his frankness when speaking and think not having a senatorial record could be beneficial. I will agree with you that the media gushes over him like a new iPod or Dove soap commercial - and yes, because of race in this case (although   in true fashion it is tiptoed around) - but the reality from what I have seen in the good ol USA is that race still very much is a factor. 

But... None of that matters. Because his speeches focus on policy, he is articulate, has ideas and makes sense. Seems like a good start to me.
IMHO, the whole "Obama is so articulate" doesn't have as much to do with his race as it does to our current president.  We have been deprived of an honest public speaker for so long that I think we've fostered a sincere desire for a leader who can speak intelligibly about issues and policy and who also is not afraid to talk to us as if we are knowledgable individuals as opposed to the r-tards the current administration makes us out to be.
...actually, if i recall correctly, the incumbent wasn't polling all that well against obama in the first place. when the divorce proceedings broke, that was the final straw that made him drop out, but he was going down in flames even before that.

...also... the whole '04 illinois senate campaign makes me want to vomit. the illinois republicans were so cynical they figured the best way to counter a charismatic black candidate was to bring in a black guy from out of state?! dear god. and they wonder why black folks loathe republicans...
Obama's chance: leaving Hillary Clinton behind.
I'm really liking what I see of Mr. Obama so far. However, I don't think he passes my first criterion -- didn't he vote *for* the Military Commission Act?
Barack is hardly from Illinois.
>Barack Obama was born in Honolulu, Hawaii to Barack Obama, Sr. of Nyangoma-Kogelo, Kenya, and Ann Dunham of Wichita, Kansas. His parents met while both were attending the East-West Center of the University of Hawaii at Manoa, where his father was enrolled as a foreign student. In his 1995 memoir, Dreams from My Father, Obama writes that in 1960, the year his African father married his American mother, interracial marriage was still a felony in over half the U.S.[2]

When Obama was two years old, his parents divorced and his father returned to Kenya. His mother then married an Indonesian foreign student, moving to Jakarta with Obama when he was six years old. Four years later, Obama returned to Hawaii under the care of his maternal grandparents.[3] He was enrolled in the fifth grade at Punahou School, where he graduated from high school in 1979.[4]

Of his years in Hawaii, Obama has written, "The irony is that my decision to work in politics, and to pursue such a career in a big Mainland city, in some sense grows out of my Hawaiian upbringing, and the ideal that Hawaii still represents in my mind."[5]

After high school, Obama studied for two years at Occidental College, before transferring to Columbia College at Columbia University. There he majored in political science, with a specialization in international relations. Upon graduation in 1983, Obama worked for one year at Business International Corporation before moving to Chicago and taking a job with a non-profit organization helping local churches organize job training programs for residents of poor neighborhoods.[6]

Obama then left Chicago for three years to study at Harvard Law School. He was elected president of the Harvard Law Review, obtaining his Juris Doctor degree, magna cum laude, in 1991. On returning to Chicago, Obama supported a voter registration drive, then worked for the civil rights law firm Miner, Barnhill and Galland, and taught constitutional law at the University of Chicago Law School.[7]

[Obama's wikipedia entry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama)
I don't need a wikipedia entry to ground my impression of the man's smugness, most Harvard Law grads who think they should be President after serving in the Senate a year are smug and Obama's narcissistic book confirms this.  He brought up the race issue first and has used it to his advantage-do you think he checked other or white on the ethnicity boxes when he was getting into good schools?  As for how he speaks, he was raised by his white mother and grandparents and it's well known that children learn to speak from those around them.  Do you really think Obama would sound the same if he had been raised in an impoverished inner city by black women after a white father from Scotland had abandoned him and his mother?

Mikhail Nikolaevitch Baryshnikov (Russian: Михаил Николаевич Барышников) (born January 28, 1948) is a famous Russian dancer, choreographer, and actor.

[Baryshnikov, whose name is sometimes transliterated as Baryshinikov or Barishinikov, was born in Riga, Latvia to Russian parents.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Barishnikov)

I put quotes around "black" because Obama was raised by white people and his mother is white but he has chosen to play the black card to his advantage.  He's racially mixed, but in America the left and right seem to agree with the white supremacist notion that one is not at all white if not purely white, whereas any bit of black or American Indian makes you a member of that minority should you wish.
...and the hits keep on coming!

...i'm assuming you saw obama's college apps before they were sent off. news flash for you, not all black people "check the box" just so they can get into a school. some, in fact, -oh! shock and awe and flabbergastery!- prefer not to check it just to rub that in the faces of morons like you who just assume they're there 'cause of their melanin.

...and, really... come on. just because someone's raised by black women doesn't mean they're gonna come out speaking like they majored in ebonics. one doesn't necessarily come out sounding like those that surround him. hell, i know of people who were born and raised in compton and speak better than any of the college grads i know.
You "know of" Compton residents who "speak better than any of the college grads" you know-interesting.  I know of people who dropped out of college to become richer than any college graduates I know.  Alert Chomsky to your new theory of language acquisition: kids will spontaneously learn to speak in order to defy norms and expectations and confound those who foolishly think the home environment plays a major role--consider the case of a Chinese boy who decided at the age of 2 to begin speaking Gaelic just to show his parents that he was his own man. 

Barack Obama is such an ethnically ambiguous name.  I'm sure he tried to conceal his racial identity and that when he decided where to start his political career he threw darts at a map and ended up with a predominantly black area famous for the likes of Jesse Jackson.
The atheist turned politician proclaiming that the Blue Staters worship a deity while those rednecks actually have libraries and gay pals.  Wow, Obama's got such insights into American democracy.  Let's make room for his perspicacity by tossing de Tocqueville's old stuff.  Dude, like, Obama says it's one country and we all like the same flag and the pledge of allegiance (except of course for those on the left who maintain the pledge is unconstitutional and that we really do wave the American flag too much and maybe it's not a big deal if millions march with the Mexican flag and people vote in foreign languages).  

Obama discovers Christianity and the flag and becomes a sensation for the Dems.  Meanwhile you're all rightly skeptical of any Republican who discovers religion on the campaign trail.
Obama supported the Iraq war

that tells me enough about his character
[(no, he didn't.)](http://www.ontheissues.org/Barack_Obama.htm)

dude, did you even read the article?
I can just see the 2008 Republican attack ads:

"Osama....Obama... Notice any similarities?"

Complete with a morphing picture of Osama turning into Obama and serious minor key music...


haha, and Fox will "accidently" call him "Presidential-hopeful Obama bin-laden"
I see it the other way around.  Obama/Clinton
Cue degustibus dismissing Obama as [an atheist](http://reddit.com/info/nmwi/comments/cnuls), [not black enough](http://reddit.com/info/nmwi/comments/cnv9p), or asserting he is culpable of [some other confusing failure](http://reddit.com/info/nmwi/comments/cnvav).

God, do I love republicans.
By 1998 GWB had already served four years as governor of the second largest state in the nation, and from what I can tell he was not the complete fuck-up in Austin that he became once elected president.  At this point Sen. Obama has served two years as the junior senator from Illinois.  He managed to get some good committee assignments (Foreign Relations, Verterans Affairs, and Environment & Public Works) that will serve him well when he does decide to run, but there is really no way you can say he has the same level of experience that GWB had when he ran for president.

Two things work in Sen. Obama's favor on this issue though:
  
1) It is a different world than it was when GWB first ran. Back then a governorship was the best way to the white house since it gave you governmental experience at an executive level without leaving behind the sort of record on making tough/unpopular decisions (which campaign opponents were duty-bound to drag up) that congressional legislators seem to accumulate.  Now it seems that being a governor of any state other than CA, TX, or NY makes you a lightweight when it comes to foreign policy and this has become an important factor.

2) By seeming somewhat inexperienced _but honest_ he can make a claim to being an "outsider."  If he were to run his campaign would pitch him as someone who has spent two years learning the workings of government and gathering experience on his senate committees while at the same time having not been a senator long enough to become captured by the environment of corruption that most of the country thinks runs the show in Washington, D.C.
Why do you feel Hillary is better equipped for the presidency than Obama?  Because she knows where all the bathrooms in the White House are?  Both were lawyers for several years.  Both will have been senators for a few years in '08.  Who Hillary was married to certainly isn't going to have any influence on my vote.  In fact, the most offensive thing to happen during Bill's time in office was spearheaded by Hillary (socialized medicine).

If Democrats want to shun a significant portion of moderate voters (and voters like me that might be convinced to hold my nose and vote Democrat just this once to get the Christ-icans out of office), Hillary is exactly the way to do it.

As cynopt said, "Hillary is unappealing to a broad section of voters".  Spot on.  I'd vote my conscience (i.e. Libertarian) before I'd vote for Hillary.

And, besides that, Obama is one good looking dude.  He'd be good for America's sagging national image.
In the same comment you criticize Obama for being a freshman senator, and then state that a former mayor would trump that?  At least say McCain would be the Republican to beat, then you might not look like such an idiot.
His middle name also happens to be Hussein. Barack Hussein Obama, Jr.

I'd really like to have enough faith in the American people to think that a man's name would have little to do with their opinions of him, but I don't.
If Obama had turned his couch upside down, I'd have heard about it in the news.

Nothing to see here, please move along.
who the fuck said he was a saint?

Get off your horse, my meaning was lost on you.
In a few years liberals will have destroyed EVERY tradition and or celebration regardless of origin.

December 25 - Christmas Day : Abolished

It was all a lie anyway.

Why not Obama/McCain? He's all for common ground, and a ticket like that would be strong all around.
>Obama is indeed a bit of a noob by D.C. standards...

All liberals are noobs.
I think Kennedy had just been elected to his second term 2 years earlier. Also, Kennedy served 6 yyears in the House before moving to the Senate, again, iirc. None of which disqualifies Obama.
Executive experience used to count for a lot, but that particular currency is worth less than it once was.  Foreign policy is now the hot attribute that candidates want to emphasize and relatively few governors and only a couple of mayors have any.

In all honesty, Obama would wipe the floor with Giuliani
Other than the Iraq war, they haven't... The economy is the best it's ever been (seen the Dow/unemployment figures lately?). The supreme court will reverse the unconstitutionality of the Military Combatents Act and the Iraq "war" will be over in 1-1.5 yrs. The Democrats will get elected this November and start to do stupid shit like trying to get same-sex marraige laws passed- come the next election the same back-lash will happen and a Republican will get elected, unless the Democrats get someone like Obama to run with them and back off the ridiculous stuff and focus on the important stuff.
I don't think the cartoon is saying that Obama *is* a ruthless bastard, btw.
Obama killed Kenny!
Nice piece on Barack Obama
Just a reminder of why he lost in the first place.

Democrats should have had the guts to nominate Dean.  One of the first rules of politics is you need to be able to make a distinction between yourself and your opponent, and Kerry was never able to do that in a clear fashion.

Yes, this is just an example of pathetic misspeaking (the NY Times had the text of the joke he was SUPPOSED to tell, which was unambiguously about Bush).

But, like, isn't expressing yourself effectively a slightly important part of being a politician?  Don't we rightly mock Bush when he says something that comes out stupid, even when we know that's not what he intended?

This is what America has come to.  A Presidential election with two candidates fundamentally challenged in matters of basic communication.  Hillary, Giuliani, McCain, Obama, are perfectly competent at expressing themselves, so maybe come 2008 we'll get to hear some non-pathetic oratory?  Even Ahnuld can talk English better than these two bozos.
Kinda after the fact here but I wanted to point out that I wasn't criticizing Obama, just pointing out his lack of experience.  And like others have said Giuliani's experience running one of the largest cities in the Western World counts for more in my mind that a few years "leglislating" as part of a lame duck congress that hasn't been able to pass anything.
I think this is a subject that needs to be discussed a lot more. Crouch says "Obama…does not…share a heritage with the majority of black Americans, who are descendants of plantation slaves."

Slavery in America is long-extinct. Blacks got a bum deal, but so have a lot of other people. There have been inroads in every state, although there is still resentment and hatred on both sides of the racial coin. There is still inequality, but that type of racism is not limited to blacks, it would be unfair to say that other racial minorities are welcomed with open arms. I believe we should all try to understand our fellow man, whatever racial background he comes from.

No. Obama is not from ancestors who were American slaves. Are you so caught up in your resentment and hatred that you are against him for that? He is the best chance for a black person to break down some barriers. Or is that your goal?

I can't imagine a single losing strategy for the Democrats in 2008 except for running "Obama". A few points:

1. He is a total media creation. The media need to remember that it is very easy for them to shove somebody in the public's face and so make a celebrity out of him. That is what they have done with BHO. They need to remember that such a creation is inorganic. Their own infatuation with so-and-so is not enough to sustain his popularity.

2. Most national-level officeholders are intelligent and charming. Saying Obama is intelligent and charming is saying that he has the minimum requirements for a Senator.

3. The unashamed trumpeting of race in any positive discussion of him should remind us: Were he white, he would be any other Senator, no more or less. When blackness is a NECESSARY condition for an individual's celebrity, you have something undeserved and untenable.

4. Image is everything. The procession from George Washington to "Barack Hussein Obama" may well be terrific in practice. However: It looks, sounds, smells, and seems by all appearances to be an "America is now a third world country" sort of thing.

5. "We have gay friends in the red states" is the single stupidest thing every deliberately said in the history of politics. The fact that that speech was considered good should throw much doubt on the media's ability to engage in human reason.
My number one gripe about Obama was his mention of God.

Intelligence and charm do matter. Most national politicians do not really have these traits at all. Bill Clinton could probably still win national elections in spite of everything. I don't think most politicians could pull that off.

Let's look at that statement from Obama in context.
>The pundits like to slice-and-dice our country into Red States and Blue States; Red States for Republicans, Blue States for Democrats. But I’ve got news for them, too. We worship an awesome God in the Blue States, and we don’t like federal agents poking around our libraries in the Red States. We coach Little League in the Blue States and have gay friends in the Red States. There are patriots who opposed the war in Iraq and patriots who supported it. We are one people, all of us pledging allegiance to the stars and stripes, all of us defending the United States of America.”

"We have gay friends in red states" works just fine for me. Few politicians would even use the word gay in that setting.

He has a spotless voting record and sponsors good legislation. Real tangible security. Government transparency. Basic health issues.

His blackness is an inevitable discussion point. But it is in no way a NECESSARY condition for his celebrity. He's young. He's passionate. He's clean.

>Image is everything. The procession from George Washington to "Barack Hussein Obama" may well be terrific in practice. However: It looks, sounds, smells, and seems by all appearances to be an "America is now a third world country" sort of thing.

You need to restate this. I'm not sure what your saying.
> "We coach Little League in the Blue States and have gay friends in the Red States."

> Ah, the whole sentence is even worse. What a bizarre dichotomy.

Obama's whole point was that that is *not* a dichotomy -- or, rather, it is a false one.
An interesting point.

But let's hope that, if Obama runs and loses, he loses in the primary. I don't think that another Republican administration will leave him a country to run for President of.
I think Krauthammer is wrong that Obama only needs to appoint himself well in the primary to secure himself an invitation to run as Vice President on the ticket. Because if Hillary Clinton wins the nomination, there's no chance she'd choose Obama as her running mate. He doesn't balance the ticket for her.
If people are voting for someone because he's black then do they feel cheated when they find out that his dad was an African immigrant who bailed on him and his white mother?  Obama has no ties to the legacy of slavery and Jim Crow that would make a black victory seem an answer to past wrongs.  He's not black like Oprah or Denzel Washington or Alan Keyes or Condoleeza.
